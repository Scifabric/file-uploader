## Simple file uploader

Just copy the settings.py.template to settings.py. Adapt where do you want the files
to be uploaded, and which extensions of images do you want to support.

Done!

## PYBOSSA integration

You can then create tasks in a PYBOSSA server, using our command line tool
or by uploading them from your local folder to another server, etc. 

Use any of our pybossa libraries or pybossa tools to achieve it.
